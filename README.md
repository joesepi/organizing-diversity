## Organizations

**[AlterConf](https://alterconf.com/)**

AlterConf is a traveling conference series that provides safe opportunities for marginalized people and those who support them in the tech and gaming industries. By highlighting the powerful voices and positive initiatives of local community members, we build hope and strengthen the community’s resolve to create safer spaces for everyone.

**[BlackGirlsCode](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/)**

Our Vision: To increase the number of women of color in the digital space by empowering girls of color ages 7 to 17 to become innovators in STEM fields, leaders in their communities, and builders of their own futures through exposure to computer science and technology. To provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040.

**[Callback Women](http://www.callbackwomen.com/)**

The mission of CallbackWomen is to radically expand gender diversity at the podium of professional programmers’ conferences. It’s about all genders underrepresented in tech, including non-binary, gender nonconforming, trans women, trans men, cis women, and more.

**[Code2040](http://www.code2040.org/)**

Code2040 is a nonprofit organization that creates pathways to educational, professional, and entrepreneurial success in technology for underrepresented minorities with a specific focus on Black and Latinx people. Code2040 aims to close the achievement, skills, and wealth gaps in the United States. Our goal is to ensure that by the year 2040 - the start of the decade when the US will be majority people of color - we are proportionally represented in America's innovation economy as technologists, investors, thought leaders, and entrepreneurs.

**[GirlDevelopIt](https://www.girldevelopit.com/)**

Girl Develop It is a nonprofit organization that exists to provide affordable and judgment-free opportunities for women interested in learning web and software development. Through in-person classes and community support, Girl Develop It helps women of diverse backgrounds achieve their technology goals and build confidence in their careers and their every day lives.

**[Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/)**

To inspire women to excel in technology careers. We envision a world where women are proportionally represented as technical leaders, executives, founders, VCs, board members, and software engineers.

**[WriteSpeakCode](http://www.writespeakcode.com/)**

Write/Speak/Code is on a mission to empower women software developers to become thought leaders, conference speakers, and open source contributors. We run conferences and events across the US.
